# OMG Forms

A WordPress Forms Solution built specifically for Developers.

## Why
As a developer I have often found working with the various Forms Plugins in WordPress to be a pain in the butt. The primary pain point is that these forms generate a ton of deeply nest markup which makes styling these forms to match a design very painful.

Plus sometimes the design calls for radical changes in how that markup is built. While all the top forms plugins allow you the ability to change that markup, it is not usually very straight-forward. 

It is my assumption that these plugins have this issue because they were built for the end user, not Developers. You see, most form plugins have a drag and drop interface that allows non-programmers the ability to create the forms. Complex form even! And that is awesome.

But this really highlights the fact that on day one, these plugins were not built for developers. They were built for power users.

## Introducing OMG Forms
That is where OMG Forms comes into play. It was built from day one to be for developers and developers only. But how can that be? Don't you need to make it for Power Users? Nope. 
I believe:
  - 90% of user only need one or two forms.
  - Once a site goes live users will rarely need to change these forms much, or at all.
  - Even if a user did want a new form, odds are I would be tasked with helping them, even though they technically have the ability to make the form themselves.

If that is the case, then why wouldn't I use a forms solution that puts the developer experience first? That is where OMG Forms comes into play.

## Roadmap
  - Setup Conditional Logic for Fields
  - Show submission data in admin view.
  - Setup Email notifications whenever a form is submitted.
